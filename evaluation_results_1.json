    "generated_fable": "Once there was a clever fox in a forest. One day, it was helping a trapped bird escape from a hunter's net. After much effort, the fox used its cleverness to gnaw through the net and free the bird. In gratitude, the bird led the fox to a hidden cache of food. Moral: Kindness is rewarded.\n",
    "evaluation": "Grammar: 9/10 - The fable is mostly grammatically correct, with good sentence structure. But there is redundancy in the use of \"cleverness\" when the trait of the fox has already been established as clever.\n\nCreativity: 7/10 - The story is straightforward and succinct with the element of unexpected treasure as reward, which is somewhat creative. A bit more elaboration or intricacy in plot could enhance the creativity.\n\nConsistency: 10/10 - The fable aligns perfectly with the structured input provided. Fox is clever, the setting is forest, it involves the fox helping a trapped bird (helping someone in need) and the fox being rewarded after (Resolution), and the moral taught is \"Kindness is rewarded.\"\n\nAge group: E - Given the writer's grasp of grammar and fable construction, it's likely the writer falls in the age group 10-12."
