        "Okay, so I need to create a fable based on the input provided. The user has given a structure, with examples, so I should follow that closely. Let me breakdown the input: \n\nCharacter: Rabbit  \nTrait: Brave  \nSetting: Forest  \nConflict: Competing for food  \nResolution: Punishment  \nMoral: Hard work pays off.\n\nWait, the example structure from the user had five specific parts: Once there was a {trait} {character} in a {setting}. One day, it was {conflict}. After much effort, {resolution}. Moral: {moral}. So I need to make sure to include each part without adding extra.\n\nFirst, the wording should be exactly as the structure requires. No deviations. The fable must start with \"Once there was a...\" Then include the trait and character, followed by the setting.\n\nConflict is about competing for food, and the resolution is punishment. The moral is that hard work pays off.\n\nI need to form a coherent story that flows naturally. Let's think about how a rabbit in a forest competing for food leads to punishment, which then teaches that hard work is rewarded.\n\nHmm, the rabbit is brave. Competing for food in the forest—maybe there's a limited food source, like a river or a good hunting spot. The conflict is the competition, so perhaps the rabbit is trying to get food but faces challenges.\n\nResolution is punishment—maybe the rabbit overstepped and gets caught. But"
