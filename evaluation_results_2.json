    "generated_fable": "Along the riverbank, a persistent turtle faced a challenge: a dangerous stream with strong currents that blocked its way to a lush meadow. Despite the danger, the turtle decided to find a solution. It began collecting sturdy sticks and stones, working tirelessly to construct a makeshift bridge. The other animals mocked its slow progress, but the turtle remained focused. After days of effort, the bridge was complete, and the turtle safely crossed the stream to the meadow. Its determination inspired others to overcome their own obstacles. Moral: Perseverance leads to success.\n",
    "evaluation": "Grammar: 10/10\nThe fable is grammatically correct, and there were no errors or inconsistencies that detracted from understanding the narrative.\n\nCreativity: 9/10\nThe fable shows a good degree of creativity. It is not easy to create an engaging and rational story based on given structured inputs, but the student did an excellent job. They creatively used each aspect and provided extra elements such as mocking of other animals adding to the richness of the story. \n\nConsistency: 10/10\nThe fable perfectly aligns with the structured input provided. All the elements - character, trait, setting, conflict, resolution, and moral - were effectively included and used appropriately in the narrative.\n\nAge group: F: 13-16\nThe fable is well-structured and reflects a more mature approach to storytelling. The presence of a moral value and the creative usage of conflict hint at an older age group, likely a teenager. Furthermore, the advanced vocabulary and sentence structure seen in the fable would generally be too complex for younger age groups."
