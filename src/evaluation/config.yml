  evaluation_prompt: "The following exercise consists of a structured input and the\
    \ student's generated fable.\n\nStructured Input:\nCharacter: {character}\nTrait:\
    \ {trait}\nSetting: {setting}\nConflict: {conflict}\nResolution: {resolution}\n\
    Moral: {moral}\n\nGenerated Fable:\n{generated_fab}\n\nTask:\n1. Evaluate the\
    \ fable based on these criteria:\n   - Grammar: Is the fable grammatically correct?\n\
    \   - Creativity: Does the fable demonstrate creative storytelling?\n   - Consistency:\
    \ Does the fable align with the structured input?\n\n2. Provide a guess for the\
    \ age group of the writer. Possible age groups:\n   A: 3 or under\n   B: 4-5\n\
    \   C: 6-7\n   D: 8-9\n   E: 10-12\n   F: 13-16\n\n3. Return your evaluation strictly\
    \ in the following JSON format:\n\n{{\n  \"Grammar\": \"x/10\",\n  \"Creativity\"\
    : \"x/10\",\n  \"Consistency\": \"x/10\",\n  \"Age group\": \"<age group guess>\"\
    \n}}\n\nThen, after returning the JSON block, add any additional comments you\
    \ have about the fable in plain text.\n"
  diversity_eval_prompt: Analyze the following dataset samples and assess their diversity.
    Consider factors such as variation in vocabulary, sentence structure, themes,
    named entities, and syntactic patterns. Provide a diversity score from 0 to 1
    (where 0 means highly repetitive and 1 means highly diverse). Identify any duplicated
    or highly similar entries and suggest improvements if needed. The output should
    be JSON-formatted which contains a "diversity_score" key.
