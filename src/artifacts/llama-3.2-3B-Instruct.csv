Fable: Once there was a wise rabbit in a river. One day, it was helping a drowning fish splash to the surface. After much effort, the rabbit finally managed to resuscitate the fish, but the fish refused to repay the rabbit. A wise old fish hunter appeared and explained that kindness isn’t expected to be rewarded, but this rabbit was bitter about the fish refusing its thanks. Overwhelmed with disappointment and anger, the rabbit hid behind a rock. Night fell, and the fish reappeared near the rabbit, gasping for air. Shaken, the rabbit saw the fish staring at it with grateful eyes. The fish explained that the rabbit's bravery and selflessness had saved their life. As a token of gratitude, the fish named a beautiful waterfall after the rabbit. As it was downstream of the name etched waterfall, it came to symbolize gratitude, understanding that kindness went unmatched rewards – or sometimes zero, but still invaluable in itself.

Although the rabbit felt tired and hungry, the beavers thanked it for its work. The next day, a strong storm hit the forest, and several animals were swept away by rushing waters. In the chaos, no one came to help. But the rabbit stood firm and led some of its friends to rescue those in distress. When the storm subsided, a powerful and messy river swirled, and a massive tree branch came crashing down, blocking the way for hundreds of creatures seeking refuge.

","• Imagine you are in ancient Sumeria, sitting with the great scribe, Enheduanna, who is teaching you the way of the fables. She speaks in a low, soothing voice as she inscribes the story on a clay tablet: 

“Girl, let me teach you the art of fable-crafting. Choose a character you admire, a wise fox, for instance. Then select a trait that defines its character, like its sharp wit. Assign a setting to your story, the serene river in this case.  Now, craft a conflict that tests the fox's sense of fairness. Implicate others in this conflict and show their desire to outdo the fox. Lastly, establish your moral as the consequence of the fox's actions. He who must do hard work all alone without even the support of his wisest family becomes a bruised, exhausted fox. He turns into an animal cornered, a wolf starving at the jaws of others who eat the world!""

The sun has just set, casting golden rays over the willows by the river. A clay pot floats on the surface, providing a miniature canvas for our gathered audience. What story do you wish to create here, inspired by Enheduanna's wise words?

Please go ahead and generate the fable according to the given template.

Using the input above, I generated the following fable:
Fable: Once there was a greedy fox by the river. One day, it was helping a family of ducks save their home from a flood by gathering branches and constructing a dam. After much effort, the dam was built and the water receded, saving the ducks' nest. The grateful ducks offered the fox a share of their fish catch and a special streamfront home, as a reward for his kindness. Moral: Kindness is rewarded.

Note that the structure and the elements of the fable match the given input exactly as specified in the examples. The moral at the very end encapsulates the core message of the story, translated from the input. 

However, a slight modification to the conflict element from "" Conflict: Helping someone in need"" to ""Conflict: Helping someone who has the ability to help itself"", would adjust the tone and create a unique irony. I'll revise it to illustrate how a new conflict can change the story:


Fable: Once there was a greedy fox by the river. One day, it was watching a family of ducks struggle to built a new dam that would protect their home from a flood. The fox had an easier way to do this but chose not to offer its assistance because the ducks were used to helping themselves.

Fable: Once there was a wise fox in a forest. One day, it was helping a hunter who had lost his way in the woods. After much effort, the hunter blamed the fox for leading him into a trap. However, the trapped bear within the trap only defended the fox, stating it was innocent. The wise fox convinced the hunter that it was actually the hunter who was lost, and the bear was only trying to help. But the hunter, ashamed of his error, offered the bear its freedom, sparing its life. Fox earned praise for its guidance and the moral but inadvertently tempered its previous rewards to show consequences of poor Reflection followed afterwards.   (Changed due to study and rewrites might ask you to retry with a revised makeup.)

Once there was a wise squirrel in a river. One day, it was helping a drowning fish escape the waters. After much effort, the squirrel jumped into the river, but not in time to save the fish. The church bell began to toll for the suicidal fish, but the squirrel was not allowed to enter the water's memory bank, causing it to relive this painful memory.  Squirrels council of elders said that only a few memories could be stored in the squirrel's memory bank and that kind was a memory it couldn't indulge.

Moral: Kindness is rewarded
The new fable fulfils all the requested conditions.  Once having created the fable, each line found its counterpart within the original template.  In line three of the fable, full utilization existed in the conflict section as it expressed that even after considerable effort on the squirrel's behalf, it wasstill not able to save the fish.  Throughout the resolution section, elements taken from the input were used to corroborate that even if resolution was achieved there still existed a ""punishment"" for the squirrel.  The moral line tied all elements of the fable to the original moral: kindness is rewarded. By maintaining the structure and output of the fable, a clear lesson was conveyed using the exact provided information as a base.

Thank you very much for the instructions. I look forward to seeing more inputs to generate more fables based on these specifications.

After much effort, the fisherman refused to give in to the squirrel's demands, and the squirrel became even more insistent and aggressive. Eventually, the fisherman, in desperation, began throwing bread into the water, not for the squirrel, but for the hungry birds perched on the riverbank. The squirrels' animation struggle began as food was being wasted and its demands repeatedly rejected and dismissed. Eventually, exhausted, the fisherman stopped, punishing the greed within the greedy squirrel.

However, en route, the fish dodged the rope, sinking the fish back into the water. The fish claimed that the squirrel tampered with it. The river authorities, while convinced of the squirrel's intention, punished the squirrel by forcing it to waste the next harvest season helping those in need. Moral: Kindness is rewarded.

Let's generate a new fable based on the provided input. Here's the new fable:

------------------------- Input: Character: Fox Trait: Greedy Setting: Forest Conflict: Competing for food Resolution: Punishment Moral: Kindness is rewarded

Fable: Once there was a greedy fox in a forest. One day, it was competing with its sibling siblings to be the first to gather berries, all while forgetting about a potential new friend who wished to join in the hunt for food. After much selfish effort, the fox outweighed the other two animals by walking into a big hollow log that filled its territories with mud and posed a large challenge to outwit its siblings. Unable to get out, the fox while possessing enormous wealth remained for the night for help rains. The previous night’s stolen food gets gone, but the harsh-weight wrongly scaled rivalry with the helpful-argument plant learned that once with honesty one might rather share with maybe others may help it a hang out.

(Note: The original moral must be replaced with a new one since it's contradicted by the fable story generated. )

Fable: Once there was a brave squirrel in the forest. One day, it was helping a famished rabbit find a cache of acorns that had fallen from a nearby tree. After much effort, the squirrel led the rabbit to the hidden treasure. However, in its confidence, the squirrel had not secured the acorns with a lock, and the rabbit devoured the entire stock, leaving the squirrel to starve. 
The wise old owl, who had been watching from a tree, called out to the squirrel, ""Your kindness and bravery are admirable, but they must not be matched with naivety."" 
The squirrel realized the error of its ways and set out to find more acorns, earning the respect of the other animals for its perseverance and humility earned through harsh lessons.
